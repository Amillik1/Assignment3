#Assignment 3

This assignment animates a dvd logo to bounce around the screen like it does on TVs. If you tap on the screen, it will change the speed and angle of which it bounces. If it bounces perfectly in the corner, you win at life.

The delay for submitting this assignment comes with the issue of trying to get a picture to move. Instead of having an ImageView that you can change the position of, I had to create a bitmap and post it to the canvas (only discovered after a week of struggle, thank you Nick for the idea!). Why I couldn't use the ImageView is beyond me. In the words of Madden himself, "I hate android studio".
